## Projects & Experience

### SOC Analyst | MSSP

2+ years in a multi-tenant Security Operations Center

- Investigated and escalated security alerts from SIEM, NGFW, VPN, IDS, and EDR systems
- Worked across various client environments to identify, contain, and document incidents
- Communicated with clients via service managers to clarify incidents and propose mitigation steps
- Participated in cyber exercises and internal simulations with prize-winning results
- Contributed to internal knowledge sharing and detection rule improvements

### Personal SOC Lab | MacBook Air M1

Elastic Stack, Suricata, Auditd, ClamAV | Resource-constrained SIEM PoC

- Built a working SIEM/IDS setup on ARM-based MacBook using Beats instead of Logstash
- Integrated Suricata, Auditd, and ClamAV with Elastic Stack for log aggregation and alerting
- Simulated attack scenarios (SSH brute force, malware execution, privilege escalation) and validated detection logic
- Practiced Linux log analysis, optimized system performance, and researched compatibility challenges

## Core Skills

**SIEM & Log Management**
- Configured and used ELK Stack (Filebeat, Auditbeat, Kibana) in personal lab
- Worked with ArcSight, MaxPatrol SIEM, and KUMA in MSSP environment for triage and investigation
- Experience with alert correlation and log source validation

**Network & Endpoint Security**
- Analyzed security data from NGFWs, VPN appliances, and endpoint detection tools in production SOC
- Investigated IDS alerts (e.g., Suricata) and Windows/Linux audit logs for suspicious behavior
- Reviewed firewall rules and AD event logs to support detection and response
- Combined endpoint and network data to build incident timelines

**Threat & Malware Analysis**
- Used ClamAV to detect malware and extract hashes via custom Bash scripts
- Performed phishing investigations, including IOC enrichment and email header analysis
- Practiced malware triage and static analysis in a sandbox using FLARE-VM tools

**Incident Response & Threat Hunting**
- Hands-on experience with triage, containment, and escalation of real incidents
- Used MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain to map adversary behavior
- Conducted manual log reviews and hypothesis-based threat hunting

**Soft Skills**
- Calm under pressure, quick learner, and strong communicator
- Experienced in writing clear incident reports and collaborating with cross-functional teams
- Naturally driven to explore and go beyond surface-level analysis
